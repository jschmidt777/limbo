SD2 Final Project:
This is my final project for Software Development 2. It is based on a WAMP environment, full stack, to create a lost and found system on a college campus. I used Foundation for the css of this application. Other than the folder called "css", all of the css for this application comes from Foundation (I hold no credit to creating anything in the Foundations framework).
Foundaiton's site can be found here: http://foundation.zurb.com. Further, I am the sole contributor/coder for this project; I did this project by myself, only starting out with example code that we used for labs that we did during the course.
